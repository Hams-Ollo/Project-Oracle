# Install Streamlit using command line

This page will walk you through creating an environment with `venv` and installing Streamlit with `pip`. These are our recommended tools, but if you are familiar with others you can use your favorite ones too. At the end, you'll build a simple "Hello world" app and run it. If you prefer to have a graphical interface to manage your Python environments, check out how to [Install Streamlit using Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/anaconda-distribution).

## Prerequisites

As with any programming tool, in order to install Streamlit you first need to make sure your
computer is properly set up. More specifically, you’ll need:

1. **Python**

We support [version 3.8 to 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **A Python environment manager** (recommended)

Environment managers create virtual environments to isolate Python package installations between
projects.

We recommend using virtual environments because installing or upgrading a Python package may
cause unintentional effects on another package. For a detailed introduction to Python
environments, check out
[Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

For this guide, we'll be using `venv`, which comes with Python.

3. **A Python package manager**

Package managers handle installing each of your Python packages, including Streamlit.

For this guide, we'll be using `pip`, which comes with Python.

4. **Only on MacOS: Xcode command line tools**

Download Xcode command line tools using [these instructions](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/4.html)
in order to let the package manager install some of Streamlit's dependencies.

5. **A code editor**

Our favorite editor is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), which is also what we use in
all our tutorials.


## Create an environment using `venv`

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder.


`cd myproject
`

2. In your terminal, type:


`python -m venv .venv
`

3. A folder named ".venv" will appear in your project. This directory is where your virtual environment and its dependencies are installed.


## Activate your environment

4. In your terminal, activate your environment with one of the following commands, depending on your operating system.


`# Windows command prompt
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS and Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
`

5. Once activated, you will see your environment name in parentheses before your prompt. "(.venv)"


## Install Streamlit in your environment

6. In the terminal with your environment activated, type:


`pip install streamlit
`

7. Test that the installation worked by launching the Streamlit Hello example app:


`streamlit hello
`


If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:


`python -m streamlit hello
`

8. Streamlit's Hello app should appear in a new tab in your web browser!

9. Close your terminal when you are done.


## Create a "Hello World" app and run it

10. Create a file named `app.py` in your project folder.

`import streamlit as st
st.write("Hello world")
`

11. Any time you want to use your new environment, you first need to go to your project folder (where the `.venv` directory lives) and run the command to activate it:

`# Windows command prompt
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS and Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
`

12. Once activated, you will see your environment's name in parentheses at the beginning of your terminal prompt. "(.venv)"

13. Run your Streamlit app.


`streamlit run app.py
`

If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:

`python -m streamlit run app.py
`

14. To stop the Streamlit server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

15. When you're done using this environment, return to your normal shell by typing:


`deactivate
`
