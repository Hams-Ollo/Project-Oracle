# Project Documentation Requirements

@project_oracle I need you to create some detailed and comprehensive application documentation for this project in the docs folder as markdown files. this needs to be a robust folder with the core, critical, and supportive documentation for this application on a high level, a developer level, and a project management level. I want these to be in markdown files. as well as a detailed README.md

My project is a chatbot that uses LLMs to help users with their questions about the project.
This is a test needle which i will hide in the docs folder to test the Agents ability to retrieve context from the docs:

```text
hams_ollo's Queen's name is: Mohini Murti Devi
```
